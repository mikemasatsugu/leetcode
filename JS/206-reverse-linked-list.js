https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list/

Given the head of a singly linked list, reverse the list, and return the reversed list.

 

Example 1:


Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [5,4,3,2,1]
Example 2:


Input: head = [1,2]
Output: [2,1]
Example 3:

Input: head = []
Output: []
 

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the list is the range [0, 5000].
-5000 <= Node.val <= 5000
 

Follow up: A linked list can be reversed either iteratively or recursively. Could you implement both?

/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * function ListNode(val, next) {
 *     this.val = (val===undefined ? 0 : val)
 *     this.next = (next===undefined ? null : next)

/**

const reverseList = (head) => {
  let previous = null;
  let current = head;
  let leader = head;

  while (current) {
    leader = leader.next;
    current.next = previous;
    previous = current;
    current = leader;
  }

  return previous;
};



/*
EXPLANATION

Using 3 pointers, we use these to keep references to previous after we change our .next
